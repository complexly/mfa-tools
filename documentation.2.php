<p>For a basic MFA we are considering that you do not include any extra options, but 
just want to focus on an Economy-Wide Material Flow Analysis for a particular system, 
without keeping track of 'back-office' affairs like managing your contacts and sources,
and without extra options like Data Quality Indicators.</p>

<p>These are the steps to use OMAT for performing a basic MFA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create your project and enter some basic settings (see <a href="omat/documentation/1">Getting Started</a>)</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
