  <h1>Metabolism of Cities Stakeholder Initiative</h1>

  <p> 
    In October 2016 the Metabolism of Cities website launched the <strong>Stakeholders Initiative</strong>.
    This is an effort to create an international network of people that work or have a stake in the field
    of urban metabolism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the past months we have spread the word about this initiative and we have set up a mailing list 
    with people that are interested to join. We now start to organize specific projects around topics
    that are of interest. These project will have a duration of 3 months, and they can involve a variety 
    of activities including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Online forum discussions</li>
    <li>Blog posts</li>
    <li>Articles about the topic of choice</li>
    <li>Webinars / Skype discussions</li>
    <li>Collaborative research projects</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The specific activities that we engage in will vary by topic and it will likely evolve over time. The 
  first topic of choice is <a href="datavisualization">Data Visualizations</a> and will run from 
  <strong>October-December 2016</strong>. </p>
  <p>
    This Stakeholders Initiative is a new and recent initiative, and open to your input and ideas. So if you
    have any ideas as to how we can move forward, please don't hesitate to <a href="page/contact">contact us</a>!

  <h2>Future Ideas</h2>

  <p>Below you can find some ideas that we are considering for future Stakeholder Initiative projects. If you 
  have any thoughts, information, or related work that you would like to submit, or you would just like to 
  encourage us to pick one of these topics, please let us know!</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>City profiles</strong>
    Make a short urban metabolism overview of different cities with data
    available through publications, grey literature and open data. The idea is
    to briefly present the local characteristics of a studied city and then
    present its metabolic balance. This could eventually provide comparable
    analysis of different cities helpful for researchers, local administration,
    planners, etc.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Teaching urban metabolism</strong>
    How do you teach urban metabolism at your university? What materials do you
    use? What different formats of teaching do you use? The idea with this
    project would be to gather good practices and relevant materials
    (eventually online free courses) to teach urban metabolism. Ideally, we
    would like to create an open and free course available for everyone online.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Study replication</strong><br />
      There are many studies done once (or sometimes a few times) on one city (or a
      few cities), but much more interesting insights can be obtained if the some
      study was done again on the same city in another year, at a neighboring city,
      or even in another country. But we all know how useful it can be to have the
      exact same study (same methodology) being replicated somewhere else. So how
      about we try to encourage that?!
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data collection</strong><br />
    We are building a <a href="data">Global Urban Metabolism Database</a> and it would
    be great to use the power of 'crowd-sourcing' to get more people involved in extracting
    data from publications, statistical websites, and other sources. We can furthermore 
    look into establishing links with cities and build a network of people who continue
    to contribute data even after this project is over.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Urban metabolism ontology project</strong><br />
    The field of ontology relates to the "naming and
    definition of the types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities
    that really or fundamentally exist for a particular domain of discourse".
    And it would be very interesting to undertake an exercise in which we try to
    name and define the types and classifications of urban metabolism work. 
    At our site we have started doing this by tagging publications and
    other work, but this system could be much improved. Similarly, keywords in 
    journals and other publications are not standardized and in general there seems to 
    not be a single classification tree for urban metabolism work. 
    </li>
  </ul>
